# Portfolio
This is my data analytics and machine learning portfolio. It comprises of projects completed for self-learning and professional purposes. All the projects are saved in separate repositories and can be accessed throught the links provided below. 

## Machine Learning (Python)

- [Maverik Time-Series Forecasting](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Maverik-Sales-Forecasting): Project assigned by Maverik. Time series analysis and rolling forecast of sales for a new Maverik store's first year of sales, incorporating seasonality using Prophet. MSBA case competition winner.
- [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Predicting-House-Prices): This project aims to predict house prices on a given data set with 80 predictors. I have utilized pandas, numpy and scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train and test a gradient boosting regression model. Documented in Jupyter notebook.
- [Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis): Machine learning model for sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews, utilizing NLP techniques and Python libraries (NLTK and Scikit-Learn) to accurately classify user sentiment as positive or negative.
- [Iris Classification](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Machine_Learning_Mastery/blob/main/Iris__ML.ipynb): Iris flower classification based on its features.
  
## Data Analysis and Visualization (SQL, Python, Power BI)

- [GDP Data Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/GDP-Data-Analysis): Gapminder dataset. This project aims to analyze GDP of all the countries over 100 years and derive valuable insights and conclusions using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- [Video Games Sales Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Video-Games-Sales-Analysis): This project aims to analyze video games sales data and derive valuable insights and recommendations using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/MSBA-Coursework/blob/main/Netflix/Bhoomika_Final_Project.ipynb): MY first ever data analysis in python using pandas, numpy and matplotlib.

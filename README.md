This is my data analytics and machine learning portfolio. It comprises of projects completed for self-learning and professional purposes. All the projects are saved in separate repositories and can be accessed throught the links provided below. 

## Machine Learning (Python)

- [Maverik Time-Series Forecasting](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Maverik-Sales-Forecasting): Project assigned and data provided by Maverik. Time series analysis and rolling forecast of sales for a new Maverik store's first year of sales, incorporating seasonality using Prophet. MSBA case competition winner.
- [House Prices Prediction](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Predicting-House-Prices): Predicted house prices on a given data set with 80 predictors. I have utilized pandas, numpy and scikit-learn to preprocess the data and train and test a gradient boosting regressor model. Documented in Jupyter notebook. Data from kaggle. 
- [Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Movie-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis): Machine learning model for sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews, utilizing NLP techniques and Python libraries (NLTK and Scikit-Learn) to accurately classify user sentiment as positive or negative.
- [Iris Classification](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Machine_Learning_Mastery/blob/main/Iris__ML.ipynb): Iris flower classification based on its features.
  
## Data Analysis and Visualization (SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau)

- <u> Suicide Death Rates by Age, Race and Sex<u>: Analyzed and visualized in Power BI. Found that people over the age of 85 and white males have consistently had the highest rate of suicide deaths between 1950 and 2018. Suicide death rates have also significantly gone up for the ages 15 to 54 over the last 20 years. Data from data.gov.
- Foundation Shades Annalysis: Analyzed and visualized in Power BI. Compared brands that offer lighter shades of foundations vs darker shades or if they offer an evenly distributed shades of foundation. Data from data.world.
- [GDP Data Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/GDP-Data-Analysis): Analyzed GDP for all the countries over 100 years and derived valuable insights and conclusions using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn). Gapminder dataset. 
- [Video Games Sales Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/Video-Games-Sales-Analysis): Analyzed video games sales data and derived valuable insights and recommendations using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn). Kaggle dataset. 
- [Netflix Data Analysis](https://github.com/bhoomika-jp/MSBA-Coursework/blob/main/Netflix/Bhoomika_Final_Project.ipynb): My first ever data analysis in python using pandas, numpy and matplotlib. Completed for a beginner python class during MSBA.
